# **GW2 Eternal Voice Activity Tracking**
**Version:** 0.1.0

## **What This Bot Does**
This bot tracks voice channel activity for members with a configurable tracking role using PostgreSQL and Redis.

### **Key Features**
‚Ä¢ **Role-Based Tracking**: Tracks members who have the configured tracking role (default: "Voice Active")
‚Ä¢ **Channel Exclusion**: Can exclude specific voice channels from tracking (e.g., AFK channels)
‚Ä¢ **Minimum Session Duration**: Only counts voice sessions lasting 20+ minutes (configurable)
‚Ä¢ **Session Rejoining**: Smart session continuation with two grace periods:
  - **Completed sessions (20+ minutes)**: If someone disconnects and rejoins within 20 minutes, it continues their previous session
  - **Short sessions (under 20 minutes)**: Held as "pending" for 5 minutes - if they rejoin quickly, the session continues; otherwise it's discarded
‚Ä¢ **Database Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL for configuration and Redis for active session tracking
‚Ä¢ **Automated Reports**: Sends weekly activity summaries via scheduled reports
‚Ä¢ **Multi-Server Support**: Can track multiple Discord servers independently
‚Ä¢ **Session Recovery**: Handles bot restarts gracefully, resuming active sessions
‚Ä¢ **Daily Backups**: Automated daily backups of all session data sent via webhook at 3 AM UTC

## **How It Works**

### **Voice Tracking System**
1. When a member with the tracking role joins a non-excluded voice channel, the bot creates a session:
   ```js
   async startSession(guildId, userId, displayName) {
     const sessionData = {
       startTime: Date.now(),
       totalTime: 0,
       displayName,
       userId,
       guildId
     };
     await redis.setex(
       `voice:${guildId}:active:${userId}`,
       24 * 60 * 60, // 24h TTL
       JSON.stringify(sessionData)
     );
   }
   ```

2. When they leave or move to an excluded channel, it saves the completed session:
   ```js
   await redis.zadd(
     `voice:${guildId}:completed`,
     Date.now(),
     JSON.stringify(completedSession)
   );
   ```

3. Sessions under the minimum duration (default: 20 minutes) are stored as "pending" for 5 minutes
   - If the user rejoins within 5 minutes, their session continues from where it left off
   - Otherwise, the pending session is discarded
4. Sessions 20+ minutes long that end are saved as "completed"
   - If they rejoin within the rejoin window (default: 20 minutes), the bot resumes with their previous time included
5. Excluded channels are completely ignored

**Example scenarios:**
- User in voice for 15 minutes ‚Üí leaves ‚Üí rejoins in 3 minutes = Session continues (pending system)
- User in voice for 15 minutes ‚Üí leaves ‚Üí rejoins in 10 minutes = New session starts (pending expired)
- User in voice for 45 minutes ‚Üí leaves ‚Üí rejoins in 15 minutes = Previous 45 minutes added to new session
- User in voice for 45 minutes ‚Üí leaves ‚Üí rejoins in 25 minutes = New session starts (rejoin window expired)

### **Data Storage**

#### **PostgreSQL - Configuration**
‚Ä¢ **Server Settings**: Tracking role, report recipients, excluded channels
‚Ä¢ **Report Logs**: History of generated reports
‚Ä¢ **Session Archives**: Long-term session data (optional)

#### **Redis - Active Tracking**
‚Ä¢ **Active Sessions**: Current voice sessions with 24-hour TTL
  ```
  key: "voice:guildId:active:userId"
  value: {"startTime": 1704470400000, "totalTime": 0, "displayName": "John", "userId": "123", "guildId": "456"}
  ```
‚Ä¢ **Pending Sessions**: Sessions under minimum duration with 5-minute TTL
  ```
  key: "voice:guildId:pending:userId"
  value: {"startTime": 1704470400000, "totalTime": 900000, "endTime": 1704471300000, "displayName": "John", "userId": "123", "guildId": "456"}
  ```
‚Ä¢ **Completed Sessions**: Recent sessions in sorted sets
  ```
  key: "voice:guildId:completed"
  member: {"userId": "123", "displayName": "John", "totalTime": 3600000, "timestamp": 1704474000000}
  ```
‚Ä¢ **Configuration Cache**: Cached settings for performance
